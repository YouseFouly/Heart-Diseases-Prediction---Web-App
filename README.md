# Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This project is a web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a machine learning model. The app is built in Python using Streamlit for easy user interaction.

Project Overview

The aim of this project was to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on a set of features. The project was deployed as a web app, making it accessible for users to interact with the predictive model.

Features of the Project:

1- Data Source: The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, containing patient data related to heart health.

2- Model Used: Logistic Regression was applied to build the prediction model.

3- Data Analysis:
    -  Correlation between all features was calculated to understand relationships within the data.
    -  Various diagrams were plotted to visualize important data trends and insights.

4- Model Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed data to accurately predict the presence of heart disease.

5- Predictive System: A predictive system was built to determine whether a patient has heart disease based on input features.

6- Deployment:
    - The trained model was saved and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
    - The app was run through the terminal using Anaconda, making it easier for users to access and use the system.
