# Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This project is a web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a machine learning model. The app is built in Python using Streamlit for easy user interaction.

Project Overview
The aim of this project was to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on a set of features. The project was deployed as a web app, making it accessible for users to interact with the predictive model.

Features of the Project:
Data Source: The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, containing patient data related to heart health.
Model Used: Logistic Regression was applied to build the prediction model.
Data Analysis:
Correlation between all features was calculated to understand relationships within the data.
Various diagrams were plotted to visualize important data trends and insights.
Model Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed data to accurately predict the presence of heart disease.
Predictive System: A predictive system was built to determine whether a patient has heart disease based on input features.
Deployment:
The trained model was saved and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
The app was run through the terminal using Anaconda, making it easier for users to access and use the system.
Testing: The web app was tested, and it provided correct results based on the model's predictions.
